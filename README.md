This Alexa skill will get information about Final Fantasy XIV in order to predict the weather in Final Fantasy XIV on your Alexa device.

It uses data from Kiku's implementation found here: https://github.com/Kikugumo/FFXIV-Weather-Forecast which was distributed under MIT License. Thank you!

This is a work in progress, not currently deployed.

Future plans:
* Supporting all Locations (only ARR zones are in model as of now)
* Reminders: "Alexa, remind me when it's raining in the East Shroud"
* Gathering node reminders?
* Boss and hunt spawns?
